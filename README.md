# JPL-HorizonSystem_Spacecraft_Plotter
Made this code to plot the distance and velocity of Parker Solar Probe relative to the Sun. 
The code itself is quite simple. I just modified the data from NASA JPL's Horizon system and then plot is using maplotlib. 
The code, in general, can be modified to plot similar stuff of other spacecrafts as long as you know how to get the data :p.
